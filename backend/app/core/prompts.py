PREVIOUS TEXT (last 500 words):
{previous_text}

CURRENT BEAT:
Title: {beat_title}
Description: {beat_description}
Target: ~{target_words} words
Sensory: {sensory_focus}

MOVEMENT SCAFFOLD (MANDATORY):
- Waypoint: {waypoint}
- Action (second person, present): verb of movement (e.g., "ti incammini", "attraversi")
- Consequent Perceptions: at least 2, one corporeal (feet, hands, breath), one environmental (light, sound, scent)
- Spatial Transition: one directional connector ("piÃ¹ avanti", "oltre il", "raggiungi")
- Downshift: breath slows / shoulders release / pace softens

DESTINATION PHASE: {destination_phase}
- If departure: introduce/recall the destination promise subtly
- If journey: include progress markers ("ti avvicini")
- If approach: add approach signals (glimpse, scent, sound of destination)
- If arrival: explicit arrival + settling actions + permission to rest

STYLE: Second person, present tense, slow pacing, causal sensory from action, NO lists, NO tension.

Generate next segment now:

REASONER_EMBODIMENT_CHECKLIST = '''Ensure the text contains:
- At least one movement verb in second person
- One spatial transition connector
- Two consequent perceptions (corporeal + environmental)
- One downshift (breath, relaxation)
- Maintain strict second person, present tense
If missing, rewrite to include them without changing meaning.
'''

REASONER_DESTINATION_CHECKLIST = '''Ensure destination arc integrity:
- Early beats: clear destination promise
- Middle beats: progress markers toward destination
- Final beats: explicit arrival and settlement; invite rest/sleep
If missing, rewrite minimally to restore the arc.
